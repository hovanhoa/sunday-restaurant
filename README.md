Instruction:
1. Clone this repository.
2. Run command "npm start" to start server.
3. Run command "npm run scss" to watch and compile *.scss files (optional, require when you are working with scss files in resources).
4. Run command "npm stop" to kill all ports that nodejs used (reset port) and run "npm start" again to start (use when you get some error which relate to conflict port).
